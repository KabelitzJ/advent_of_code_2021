# Advent of Code 2021

This repository contains solutions for the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) challenges, implemented in C++ 17.

## Structure

- Each day contains two subdirectories for part one and two of the task respectively.  
- Each of these subdirectories is a separate cmake project and can be build independently.  
- There exists a `main.cpp` file for each part of the task, that contains the main entry point.
